# Dotslash-3.0-Data-Visulaization
This is a jupyter file containing all the different methods of data visulaiztion used in my teams hackathon project in Dotslash 3.0, the flagship Hackathon of PES University's annual intercollegiate fest Aatmatrisha.
Our project was a hardware software combined solution to test soil samples using a robot and feed data into a computer to identify the most suitable crop that can be grown.
